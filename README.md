# RealTimeRegression

RealTimeRegression is a framework that helps you perform realtime regression based on attributes of the model like time spent in viewing, image histogram, and title

Usage:

You can use FavoriteWrapper<T> class with any object and populate the wrappers in it.
For Example:

// For struct
struct PlanetModel: Identifiable, Codable {
    let id = UUID()
    let image: String
    let title: String
    let description: String
    let date: String
}

// You can use it like this 
let mars = FavoriteWrapper<PlanetModel>()

// Actual data
mars.model.image = "www.imageurl.com"
mars.model.title = "Mars"
mars.model.description = "Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun â€“ a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere."
mars.model.date = Date()

//Meta data for ML
mars.title = mars.model.title
mars.imageHistogram = UIImage(named: "mars.png")imageHistogram()

//when the user opens the detail view for this object do
mars.hasOpened = true

//While exiting from detailview do this 
mars.hasClosed = true

//Once you do this timeSpent will be populated and fed into the datagram for this specific object in timespent attribute
mars.timeSpent

//Finally you will receive the inference in the form of 
 let result = try await RealTimeRegression.shared.computeRecommendations(basedOn: allPlanets)

// You can adjust the recommendations by setting recommendations parameter like this 
RealTimeRegression.shared.set(recommendations: 4)

// If you want further help you can consider the code example in which I have used this framework

Note: This framework can only work with iOS 15 and beyond as it is built on top of CreateML which is only supported for iOS 15 and beyond
